# App Icons and Metadata

This directory contains the app metadata files required by Next.js.

## Required Icons

Replace the default placeholder icons with your own branded images:

### Social Media & SEO Images

> The images shown below are NOT included with the boilerplate and must be added for a correct application experience. Maintain sizes.

- **opengraph-image.png** (1200 x 630) - Open Graph image for social media sharing
- **twitter-image.png** (1200 x 600) - Twitter/X card image

### App Icons

- **icon.svg** - Vector icon (already included, customize as needed)

> The icons shown below are NOT included with the boilerplate and must be added for a correct application experience. Maintain sizes.

- **icon.png** (512 x 512) - PNG fallback icon
- **apple-icon.png** (180 x 180) - Apple touch icon for iOS devices
- **favicon.ico** (48 x 48) - Browser favicon

## Current Status

The project includes `icon.svg` as a placeholder. You should replace it and add the missing images before deploying to production.

## Generating Icons

You can use tools like:

- [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/elegantapp/pwa-asset-generator)
- [Figma Export](https://www.figma.com/) for design assets

## Next.js Metadata

These files are automatically detected by Next.js and used in the app metadata. See:
